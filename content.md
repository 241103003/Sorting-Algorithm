 📘 Topic: Sorting Algorithms

 🧠 Overview

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order—typically ascending or descending. Efficient sorting is crucial in optimizing other algorithms, such as search and merge operations.

There are two main categories:

- **Comparison-based sorting** (e.g., Bubble, Merge, Quick)  
- **Non-comparison-based sorting** (e.g., Counting, Radix)

Each sorting algorithm has its own performance characteristics and ideal use cases.

 🔢 Basic Concepts

What is Sorting?

Sorting is the process of ordering elements of a list/array based on a comparison operator (e.g., `<`, `>`). It helps improve data organization and speeds up searching.

 Sorting Properties:

| Property   | Meaning                                   |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Stability  | Equal elements retain their original order |
| In-place   | Uses constant extra memory (O(1))          |

 Time Complexity

Performance in Best, Average, and Worst cases.

 🧮 Step-by-Step: Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple, intuitive algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

 Step 1: Understand the logic

Compare adjacent pairs and "bubble" the largest element to the end.

 Step 2: Code it

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
````

### Step 3: Visualize

For `arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]`

* After 1st pass: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`
* After 2nd pass: `[2, 1, 3, 4]`
* …and so on.

## 🚀 Efficient Sorts: Merge and Quick Sort

### 🔹 Merge Sort – Divide and Conquer

1. Divide the array into halves.
2. Recursively sort each half.
3. Merge sorted halves.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        arr[k:] = L[i:] + R[j:]
```

### 🔹 Quick Sort – Pivot and Partition

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[0]
    left = [x for x in arr[1:] if x < pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr[1:] if x >= pivot]
    return quick_sort(left) + [pivot] + quick_sort(right)
```

| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Small dataset, nearly sorted   | Insertion Sort            |
| Large dataset, average case    | Quick Sort                |
| Requires guaranteed worst case | Merge Sort                |
| Need to preserve order         | Stable Sort (e.g., Merge) |
| Fixed range integers           | Counting / Radix Sort     |
